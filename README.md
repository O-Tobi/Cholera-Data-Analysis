# Cholera-Data-Analysis
This is a personal project meant to showcase my data analysis and visualization skills. The dataset was gotten from <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/cholera-dataset">Kaggle</a> and it contains data of over 150 countries across all WHO regions from 1949 - 2016.

## INTRODUCTION 
Cholera is a severe diarrheal illness caused by a <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> bacterial infection of the intestine. People can become ill if they consume cholera-contaminated food or water. The infection is often minor or without symptoms, although it can sometimes be severe and life-threatening.
Since its discovery in Italy in 1854, cholera has been a global menace. Despite the discovery of a vaccine, it's regrettable that cholera continues to ravage some countries. As a result, the impetus for this brief analysis.
The dataset contains 2,469 rows and 6 columns which will be explored for this project.

## OBJECTIVES
To provide insight into how much cholera has dealt with the world in the past. 

## PROCEDURES 
- Data cleaning (ensure data is free from errors, whitespace, null values and properly formatted)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization 

## TOOLS USED
- Excel
- Tableau 

## Data Cleaning Process 
The data contains 2,469 rows and 6 columns. Null data that cannot be sort for were removed and I was left with 2,435 rows of data. 
Spelling errors were also corrected.

## OBSERVATIONS AND INSIGHTS 
- From 1949 - 2016, there were about 9,058,598 reported cases of cholera with 8,161,417 recoveries and 897,181 reported deaths.
- Africa has the highest number of reported cases.
- South East Asia has the highest number of recorded deaths.
- For individual countries, India tops the chart for the highest number of reported cases, recoveries, and casualties.
